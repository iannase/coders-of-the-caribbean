# Coders of the Caribbean Contest

In this game, you are in command of pirate ships and your goal is to avoid running out of rum. If all the rum dries up on a given ship, your crew will go mad and you will lose the ship. Barrels of rum are placed randomly across the map. You must control the movements of your ship in order to collect the barrels of rum before your opponent does.
